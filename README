This is a simple application in Play! Framework 2.0.4, using scala and MongoDB.  
It parse the RSS Flux of a tv guide website and expose a REST HTTP API, giving datas in JSON.  
You can use the following:  
  * *programs/channels/<channel>* To get the list of the programs by channel
  * *programs/yyyy-MM-dd* To get the programs by date
  * *programs/programname* Get the diffusion of the program

It's very simple and surely has some bugs, but it just to try Play! Framework with scala and MongoDB.
